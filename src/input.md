The construction involved the erection and development of a large industrial facility with a total area of about 2500 mï¿½ (foundations, production and administrative blocks).
Specifically:
Piled foundation: about 80 piles were driven (each averaging 8-10 m in length, with design load depending on soil characteristics).  
Volume of concrete work: over 1200 m3 (monolithic foundations, pits, slabs, road surfaces).  
Earthworks: more than 3000 m3 during excavation of pits and trenches, followed by backfilling with sand and soil.  
Pipelines (HVAC, technological, heating/water supply/sewage systems): total length about 2 km, including both underground and above-ground parts.  
Metal structures (columns, beams, trusses, platforms, stairs): totaling up to 250 tons of steel, with mandatory anti-corrosion treatment.  
Interior and exterior finishing works (facades, roofing, engineering networks, landscaping).  
Power supply and instrumentation and control systems: laying of 0.4-6 kV cables; installation of power distribution cabinets and automated process control panels; installation of lighting and welding equipment; grounding and lightning protection.  
Equipment: installation of pumps, fans, GPT units, fire extinguishing systems; if necessary, installation of heavy dynamic equipment with adjustment and commissioning.  
The entire project was implemented with quality control at all key stages-from soil testing during piling to hydraulic, pneumatic, and electrical testing of installed systems.
